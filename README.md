### Kuroneko Botto
Kuroneko is a simple discord bot that plays music and rolls dice. She also helps with Warhammer Fantasy rp, but only in polish language. To check her commands type / and discord will suggest them.    
You can add Kuroneko to you discord server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738883479902617670&permissions=8&scope=bot).  
She used to support League of Legends progress tracking but there are problems with new Riot API after summoner name removal, so this functionality is currently disabled.  
13.04.24 - Whole project migrated to Spring boot
