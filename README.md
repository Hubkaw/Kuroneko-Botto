# Kuroneko-Botto

A simple bot for your Discord server. The prefix is ';' but you can also start the message with 'Kuroneko' or by pinging her. Commands available with ;help

You can add Kuroneko to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738883479902617670&permissions=8&scope=bot), but it won't work until i have a new server.

19.10.23 - you can now register your League of Legends account with ;register <summonerName> command.  
Kuroneko will start informing you of your progressions (e.g. division up) on that channel. 
I hope that nobody does that since my api limits are shit.
