# Kuroneko-Botto

A simple bot for your Discord server. She uses discord interactions for commands, which means that if you start typing with '/' discord will suggest her commands to you.

You can add Kuroneko to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738883479902617670&permissions=8&scope=bot), and she currently works!!!  
  
18.03.24 - league integration is disabled until Orianna is updated or I find a better way to manage Riot API requests.
